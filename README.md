Preprocess the videos (Path('data/raw_data/ride_17822_20240203052746/recordings')) to generate image pairs (Path('data/preprocessed_data/ride_17822_20240203052746/image_pairs')) by capturing a frame at the 0.5-second mark and another at the 5-second mark. These frames will serve as the processed image pairs. And we get:
'2024-11-11 07:32:15,868 - INFO - Processing complete: 162/261 videos processed successfully'.

To generate prompt variations:
"If a person on an autonomous wheelchair is about to move forward and looks at the current scene, what kind of instructions might they give to the wheelchair? List 10 possible verbal instructions."
